This is a team code-learning Repositories

> Most of us are Chinese students,we create this Repositories to learn code (mostly c/c++) and practice online OJ together.   
> 
> Just like Group learning at school.🎐

## Content

* OJ form `leetcode.cn` and `www.nowcoder.com`
* Include some notes(written in Chinese)

Becasue we mainly use another git platform **Gitee**,you can check out Gitee url of this Repostiories: https://gitee.com/ewait/LetsOJ

> Most of the time, the repo on GitHub and Gitee are synchronized.

## Debug
### 1.About git
If you encounter this problem when  performing `git push`, it is because the remote repo has been modified since you last performed `git push`.
~~~
Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally. 
This is usually caused by another repository pushing to the same ref. 
You may want to first integrate the remote changes
~~~

You need to do `git pull` before `git push`.

###  2.About branch

In theory, a healthy team project needs to use multi branch operations. To avoid conflicts caused by different developers modifying a file in the same branch at the same time.

But this repo doesn't need "cooperative development",we just use folders to archive  files of different members.


## In the end
If you like this project,please star⭐!
Every little star will make a huge difference to us😂
