## Debug
### 1.about git
If you find this err while using `git push`,that's because the remote has been changed sence you last`git pull`.
~~~
Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally. 
This is usually caused by another repository pushing to the same ref. 
You may want to first integrate the remote changes
~~~

You need to do `git pull` before `git push`


## In the end
