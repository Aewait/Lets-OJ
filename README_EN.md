This is a team code-learning Repositories

> Most of us are Chinese students,we create this Repositories to learn code (mostly c/c++) and practice online OJ together.   
> 
> Just like Group learning at school.🎐

## Content

* OJ form `leetcode.cn` and `www.nowcoder.com`.
* Include some notes.
* The notes are written in Chinese. It doesn't matter if you don't understand them.

Becasue we mainly use another git platform **Gitee**,you can check out Gitee url of this Repostiories: https://gitee.com/ewait/LetsOJ

> Most of the time, the repo on GitHub and Gitee are synchronized.

## Debug
### 1.About git
If you encounter this problem when  performing `git push`, it is because the remote repo has been modified since you last performed `git push`.
~~~
Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally. 
This is usually caused by another repository pushing to the same ref. 
You may want to first integrate the remote changes
~~~

You need to do `git pull` before `git push`.
